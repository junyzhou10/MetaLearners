Title: Meta-learners for individual/heterogeneous treatment effect estimation & optimal treatment recommendation

Description: The package is developed for treatment recommendation & pairwise treatment individual 
  effect estimation, i.e., ITE/HTE/CATE. It includes some published methods such as S-learner, T-leaner, 
  X-learner, and R-learner and some newer/unpublished methods like reference-free simplex R-learner 
  and de-Centralized-learner. Angle-based direct learning (AD-learner), an outcome-weighting-based 
  treatment recommendation method, is included as well.
