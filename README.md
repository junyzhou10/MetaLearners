It includes some published methods such as S-learner, T-leaner, X-learner, and R-learner and some newer/unpublished methods like reference-free simplex R-learner and de-Centralized-learner. Angle-based direct learning (AD-learner), an outcome-weighting-based treatment recommendation method is included as well.
